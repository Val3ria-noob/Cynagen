Minecraft username: CapnClumzy

I was banned on: June 27

I was banned by: (Leave blank if unknown)

I was banned for: saying N1GGA

A brief summary of what happened before the ban was: I and a couple of my friends were trolling a friend by putting signs I assumed that if I add 1 in the n-word i wouldn't get banned

I like to be unbanned because: I love playing in this server and with others and not being a toxic poop. 

I often slap little kids because: um um I have am not a dad

Additional information: (Optional) I am truly deeply sorry for my actions and I'm sorry if offended anyone with my actions I do indeed like this server the freedom and I made lovely friends that mean a lot to me and it's my birthday :)
